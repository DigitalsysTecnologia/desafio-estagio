### üëæ "How do I use this?" 
First of all, you must clone this repository and have the Go language installed in your machine. After this:
<ul>
  <li> Open the terminal on your code editor;</li>
  <li>Type these commands: </li>
  
    ```
     go mod tidy
    ```
    ```
      go run migrate/migrate.go
    ```
  
    ```
      go run main.go
    ```
</ul>

<p> After, go the the file ".env" and "main.go". There, you will find the PORT and the endpoints that were built: </p>
<ul>
    <li> /signup - send a JSON data to signup. Example: </li>
</ul>

    ```
        {
            "Email": "fulano@gmail.com",
            "Password": "Fulano@123!"
        }
    ```
<ul>
    <li> /login - use the same credentials that you used on the /signup. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li> /validate - it's a GET, so you just type "localhost:3001/validate" and see if you are authenticated. If you are, now you can access the adventurers routes! </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li> [POST] /adventurers - Create an aventurer. Send a JSON data:  </li>
</ul>

            "Class": "his/her class. Example: warrior."
            "Mission": "his/her mission. Example: fight with the enemy"
        }
    ```
<ul>
    <li> [GET] /adventurers - return all the adventurers.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li> [GET] /adventurers/:id - return the adventurer with the id you typed.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li> [PUT] /adventurers/:id - return the adventurer with the updated informations. Send a JSON file like you sent in the POST route before.  </li>
</ul>
